# Libre Solar BMS C1

![Development Stage](https://img.shields.io/badge/development%20stage-eval-yellow.svg) Tested prototype, only minor issues left.

This repository contains the files for ongoing development of the Libre Solar BMS C1.

**Remark:** This BMS was previously named **BMS 16S100 SC**. It was renamed to C1 (with C for compact/centralized) because the maximum current and supported number of cells depend on the parts actually populated on the PCB, so these specs should not be encoded in the PCB name.

The development of this BMS is funded by the [EnAccess foundation](https://enaccess.org).
